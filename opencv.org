# OpenCV Note

* Errors
  1. undefined reference to symbol '_zn2cv6imreaderkns_6stringei'

  ---
  imread/imwrite and friends were moved from highgui to a new imgcodecs module.
  
  so you will have to
  
  #include "opencv2/imgcodecs.hpp"
  
  and link
  
  -lopencv_imgcodecs
  
  btw, include path should be:
  
  -I/usr/local/include
  
  not
  
  -I/usr/local/include/opencv

  不过不需要将包含目录改为 -I/usr/local/include,

  至少对于 OpenCV3 来说包含目录为 /usr/local/include/opencv2 即可
